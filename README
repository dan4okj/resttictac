# Restful Tic Tac Toe Game Service


A 2 player tic-tac-toe game over JSON API.


## Run the service

	1. Add the directory to your GOPPATH
	2. make deps - install dependencies
	3. make run - Runs the API Service on port 5000
	4. (optional) make test - run tests

## Todos:
	- [ ] Handle 500s and 400s status codes seperately. Currently the 500 in the play endpoint is not good
	- [ ] Figure a smarter way to check the board (maybe a bit nitpicky)
	- [ ] Add more tests. Coverage is ~55%
	- [ ] Parse requests more comprehensively. Check content type, so on

## Endpoints:
/game  GET - gives JSON representation of the current state of the game
/game  PUT - Player Makes a move
				{"col": <col_no>, "row": <row_no>, "move": <move>}
					col_no/row_no - 0-2 int
					move - X/O str
/game POST - starts a new game only if the current one is completed
